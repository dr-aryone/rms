# RocMetalScene.com

This is the codebase for an upcoming website that will help Rochester, NY locals track heavy metal shows in the area. The application displays upcoming shows, allows users to register and save shows they want to see, and there is a basic admin interface for adding shows and venues to the system.

While the app is functional, it is not yet made "pretty" and does not have a way to create an admin user without modifying a user directly in the Mongo CLI. 

This code exists here for practical, educational and job-hunting purposes. Fork if you like and skin it to your suiting, if that's your thing.
